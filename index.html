<h1>A List of Favorite Boardgames:</h1>
<p> <em>This list was originally as part of my application materials to UChicago in 2017. And a lot of it is still true today.</em></p>
   <p>Delightful and timeless, card and board games are peculiar mediums made for the purpose of entertainment and fun, whilst designed to have usually one winner display their dominance over the rest of the players by using their luck, intelligence, creativity, and cunning to achieve victory.  In my eyes, there is never a wrong time for a card or board game. These are the few I put at the top of the list:</p>

         <ol>
            <li><b>UNO</b></li>
            <p>There’s no surprise that this is number one on the list. Often intense enough to postpone friendship for the glory of victory, this deceptively simple game of matching colors and numbers has completely decimated the competition. There are no winners in Uno; there is only a winner, making victory all the sweeter.

            <li><b>Pusoy Dos</b></li>
            <p>A popular game in the Philippines, Pusoy Dos is a game of strategy and knowing your enemy. Using a single deck, cards are divided up into four piles ideally for four people. Each person wrestles for control of the middle pile by putting down cards in hierarchical order and the first one to get rid of his or her cards wins. Although the type of cards you possess control your strategy, it doesn’t matter what cards you have, rather how you use the cards you’re dealt.

            <li><b>Clue</b></li>
            <p>Clue AKA Homicide: the game is a battle of wits and a race against time. Trying to deduce the killer, the murder weapon, and the scene of the crime is filled with hilarity with names like Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum.

                </figure>
            <li><b>Civilization</b></li>
            <p>A game of worldbuilding and conquest, each player takes on the role of a nation as they attempt to rule the world. Each game is so intense that in most cases, it takes hours to finish a single game.
            </p>

                </figure>
            <li><b>Life</b></li>
            <p> A relaxing yet competitive game of who can reach the highest status simplifies the issues of actual life into a thirty minute period where we actually have some semblance of control.

            <li><b>Checkers</b></li>
            <p>Unlike Chess or Life, there is no class division among Checker pieces. Two sides at war have a single goal to annihilate each other. In this game, any pawn can become a king, and any king can be killed by a mere pawn.
            </p>

                </figure>
            <li><b>Contact</b></li>
            <p> A word game to guess a word only using similarly spelt words is basically a game of who has the best vocabulary. Winners not only bask in the game’s victory but also their own intelligence.
            </p>

            <li><b>Pretty Pretty Princess</b></li>
            <p>Regardless of gender or reputation, no one can resist the temptation of being a beautiful princess. Adorning various pieces of jewelry, not only do you assert your dominance, but you also feel indescribably pretty, the priceless reward of good self-esteem.

   <p><em>Note to reader: These were my precious thoughts when I was in high school. When asked to make a list of my favorite things, I picked to do something as mundane and pointless as boardgames for such an important essay. This is because at my core, I belive that it is the mundane that keeps life moving. It is the pointless thing of joy that brings meaning to us as without it we are as good as dust. I invite you to make a list of your favorite things as well and keep childlike wonder in mind as you go about your life. </em></p>
